Stackly is a cutting-edge app that empowers businesses and contractors to communicate and collaborate with their clients in real-time, streamlining service delivery and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Use Case

Let's say a contractor is building a website for a client. With Stackly, they can connect on the platform, discuss project details, and track progress together. The client can:

- Monitor the contractor's work and progress in real-time
- Request new features and ideas
- Receive live updates and respond accordingly

Meanwhile, the contractor can:

- Showcase their progress and completed tasks
- Address client requests and concerns
- Keep the client informed every step of the way

### Key Features:

1. **Live Project Tracking:** Clients can monitor their project's development in real-time, ensuring transparency and up-to-date information.

2. **Interactive Communication:** Built-in messaging system allows for instant communication between clients and contractors, facilitating quick decision-making and problem-solving.

3. **Progress Visualization:** Contractors can easily showcase their work progress, helping clients understand the project's current state and upcoming milestones.

4. **Feature Request System:** Clients can submit and discuss new ideas or feature requests directly within the platform.

5. **Task Management:** Contractors can update task statuses, allowing clients to see which parts of the project are complete, in progress, or pending.

6. **Email Notifications:** Clients receive email alerts for important updates, ensuring they never miss critical information even when they're not actively using the platform.
